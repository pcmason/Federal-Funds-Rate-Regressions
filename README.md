# Federal-Funds-Rate-Regressions
Running Regressions in R to see the the correlation between unemployment and inflation rate with the Federal Funds Rate.
Got the data from the Chair the Fed game: https://www.sffed-education.org/chairthefed/
Also should change the working directory when you run it in RStudio.
